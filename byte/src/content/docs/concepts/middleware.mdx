Middlewares are functions that execute sequentially before the handler or validator if presented.
```ts
(ctx) => {
    // Do something with the context
}
```

If a middleware returns a [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object, the object is returned as a response directly.

If a middleware returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) it should be an async function for the compiler to detect and inline the validator call.

To register middlewares for all handlers of a `Byte` instance:
```ts
// Register one middleware
app.use((ctx) => {
    // Do something
});

// Register multiple middlewares
app.use(
    (ctx) => { /* Set some props */ },
    (ctx) => { /* Maybe do headers validation */ },
    ...
);
```

These middlewares will execute after the app instance middlewares and before the validator.
