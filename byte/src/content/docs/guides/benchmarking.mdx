Since speed is a priority for Byte, benchmark results are crucial for us.

### Routers
We measure the matching performance of JavaScript routers, which includes [Blitz](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bit-js/blitz), the internal router of Byte.

You can see the benchmark source code [here](https://github.com/bit-js/bench/tree/main/routers).

### Frameworks
We compare Byte performance with other commonly used frameworks such as Fastify, Elysia and Hono.

Here is the latest results:
