                <h2>The idea</h2>

                <p>Assume that you have a dictionary and you need to search for the word <code>user</code>.</p>
                <p>
                    What you often do is search for a section of words that starts with <code>u</code>,
                    and in that section you search for words that has <code>s</code> as the second
                    character, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case, a radix tree can represents all possible steps that you need to do to search in a list
                    of words, by
                    categorizing them into small sections with similar prefixes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many good radix tree router implementations out there but we gonna continue with
                    <code>@medley/router</code>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>The problem</h2>

                <p>
                    As we are using a tree data structure, each time we match a string we need to tranverse the tree
                    (often recursively) and
                    check the current string with the current node prefix. Since we are doing it in JavaScript this
                    comes with a significant overhead.
